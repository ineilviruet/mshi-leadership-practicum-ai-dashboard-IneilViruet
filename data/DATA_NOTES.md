## Data Notes

This dataset was created for an academic leadership practicum project using simulated, de-identified data.

The data represents operational workflow information from a hypothetical hybrid healthcare network that includes Primary Care, Behavioral Health, a Diabetes Clinic, and Telehealth services.

The dataset covers an approximate three-month period and includes information related to appointment attendance, wait times, service duration, communication channels, and satisfaction indicators.

No real patient data or protected health information (PHI) is included. This dataset is used solely for educational and portfolio purposes.
