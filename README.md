## Practicum Context

This project was completed as part of a Health Informatics leadership practicum. It focuses on analyzing operational workflow data from a hybrid healthcare network that includes Primary Care, Behavioral Health, a Diabetes Clinic, and Telehealth services.

The goal of the project is to use data and informatics tools to identify workflow bottlenecks and opportunities for leadership-driven improvements in efficiency and patient engagement.

## Leadership Question

What operational patterns in appointment attendance, wait times, and communication channels indicate opportunities for leadership intervention to improve workflow efficiency and patient engagement?

## Data Description

This project uses a simulated, de-identified operational dataset representing approximately three months of healthcare service interactions. Each row represents a single appointment or client interaction.

Key variables include:
- Department or service line  
- Appointment status (attended or no-show)  
- Wait time  
- Service duration  
- Communication channel  
- Satisfaction score  

The dataset contains between 50 and 300 records and is used for academic purposes only.
