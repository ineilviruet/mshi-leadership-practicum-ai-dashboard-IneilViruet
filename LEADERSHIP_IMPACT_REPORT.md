# Leadership Impact Report

## Introduction and Practicum Context

This leadership practicum project was completed as part of a Health Informatics graduate program. The project focuses on analyzing operational workflow data from a simulated hybrid healthcare network that includes Primary Care, Behavioral Health, a Diabetes Clinic, and Telehealth services.

The purpose of this analysis was to provide leadership with a concise, data-informed snapshot of workflow patterns that may impact efficiency, patient engagement, and service delivery. As a practicum student, my role was to apply informatics tools and leadership concepts to interpret operational data and propose realistic improvement strategies.


# Leadership Question

What operational patterns in appointment attendance, wait times, and communication channels indicate opportunities for leadership intervention to better improve workflow efficiency and patient engagement?


## Data and Methods

This project used a simulated, de-identified operational dataset representing approximately three months of healthcare service interactions. Each record represents a single appointment or client interaction.

Key variables included:
- Department or service line  
- Appointment status (attended or no-show)  
- Wait time  
- Service duration  
- Communication channel  
- Satisfaction score  

Google Sheets was used to clean the data and create pivot tables summarizing appointment attendance, average wait times by department, and communication channel patterns. An AI tool was then used to generate leadership recommendations based on observed trends, which were critically evaluated from a feasibility and leadership perspective.

## Key Findings

- Attended appointments accounted for the majority of visits; however, no-shows represented a good portion of scheduled appointments across departments.
- Average wait times varied by department, with some service lines experiencing longer waits than others.
- Communication channels showed differing associations with appointment attendance, suggesting that certain outreach methods may be more effective than others.

AI-generated insights emphasized the importance of targeted communication strategies, real-time monitoring of operational metrics, and leadership-driven workflow adjustments.

## Leadership Analysis

From a leadership perspective, these findings highlight opportunities to improve operational efficiency and patient engagement through data-informed decision-making. Variation in wait times suggests the presence of workflow bottlenecks that could be addressed through staffing adjustments, scheduling optimization, or process redesign.

Differences in appointment attendance across communication channels indicate that leadership could leverage preferred communication methods to reduce no-shows and improve engagement. Using informatics tools to monitor these metrics supports proactive leadership interventions rather than reactive problem-solving.

## Action Plan

Based on the data and leadership analysis, the following actions are recommended:

1. Implement targeted appointment reminders using communication channels associated with higher attendance rates.
2. Develop simple dashboards to monitor wait times and appointment attendance by department.
3. Review scheduling and staffing workflows in departments with longer average wait times.
4. Use operational data to guide continuous quality improvement discussions at the leadership level.
5. Incorporate equity-focused considerations when designing communication and outreach strategies.

## Reflection on Leadership Growth

This project strengthened my ability to translate data into actionable leadership insights. I developed greater confidence in using informatics tools to identify workflow patterns and propose realistic improvement strategies.

The experience reinforced the importance of critical evaluation when using AI-generated recommendations, emphasizing that effective leadership requires balancing innovation with feasibility, equity, and organizational capacity. This practicum project connects directly to prior leadership coursework by demonstrating the practical application of data-informed decision-making in a healthcare context.
